      <p>When in 2012 the Uruguayan president Jose Mujica announced that the Government was legalizing Marijuana, not all Marijuana activists were happy with those news. Some of them rejected the project, as they didn't want the government to control production and distribution. Others show in this project an opportunity of consuming without going to jail. This video shows those two diferent positions.</p>
      <p>This story was made for the independent production company Storyhunter, and was choosen Storyhunter of the Month (March 2013). My rol: producer.</p>
