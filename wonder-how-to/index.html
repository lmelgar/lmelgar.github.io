    <h1>How to use the WONDER database</h1>

    <section>

      <p>The CDC's <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/">Wide-ranging OnLine Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER)</a> is an easy-to-use internet system that makes the data resources of the CDC available to the public.</p>

      <p>It provides access to a wide array of public health information, including reports on mortality, suicides, emergency room reports, and other statistical research data that is of interest to reporters in the gun space. You can use it to query numeric data sets via "fill-in-the blank" web pages. </p>

      <p>For example, you might want to find out how many total firearm deaths there were in the U.S. in the most recent year, or how many gun suicides there were in a given year, based on mortality data. Or, you might want to find out how the gun homicide rate has changed over the past 20 years. Or you can even use this query system to uncover the total number of gun suicide deaths in a particular state or within a certain demographic.</p>

      <p>Here's a short, how-to video on how to do a basic query on firearm homicides using the mortality data recently released by the CDC in November 2018.</p>
